Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) is a 'big-leaf', semi-mechanistic model to estimate photosyntheis. This code was written
a few years back and is based on Mahadevan et al. (2008; Global Biogeochemical Cycles). I am posting it here in case someone finds it useful
and modifies it to incorporate more recent changes. Please see Mahadevan et al. (2008) for the details of the model.
